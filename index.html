<p>newsyNew Delhi : Members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) should step up communication, bridge differences and replace competition with cooperation, Chinese President Xi Jinking said on Tuesday against the backdrop of the border standoff with India. His speech included a pitch for cooperation between China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which India opposes, and development strategies of other countries and regional cooperation initiatives.
“We should work together to broaden the Belt and Road as a path of happiness benefiting the whole world,” Xi said. Pakistani PM Shebat Sharif also held up the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor — a flagship project of the BRI – as a force multiplier for regional connectivity, stability, peace and prosperity.
Russian President Vladimir Putin mentioned the war in Ukraine and indicated his grip on power was strong after an attempted armed rebellion by the mercenary Wagner group last month.
